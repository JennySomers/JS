      <p><em>Creative Director at <strong>Jenny's Graphics</strong></em></p>
      <p>I am owner and sole graphic designer at Jenny's Graphics. After working many years in a corporate setting, I find working for myself rewarding and challenging. My previous employers included IBM, MDA, Allied-Signal, Foothills Graphics, and Burr-Brown Corporation. While employed at IBM, I received a Distinguished Engineer's Award and I'm named on an IBM patent. While owning and operating Foothills Graphics, I invented a 3rd party plugin for CorelDRAW called TEKit and sold the algorithms to Corel Corporation.</p></td>
